### Hi, I'm Edward  :wave:

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence :brain:, and I have a particular interest in LLMs and Multi-modal models.

My Github contains projects ranging from using language and vision model agents to complete complex task pipelines, to optimisations allowing these large models to run efficiently on GPU hardware.

There are also some cryptocurrency and blockchain related projects here (all of which are in early stages at the moment).

Feel free to shoot me an email via <edwardjls@gmail.com>!
